- Use `kebab-case` for all file names
- Prefer `function` over `const` for functions
- Use `Array<T>` over `T[]` for arrays
- Use `camelCase` for schema names and add `Schema` suffix to all
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
- Implement early returns for better readability.
- Prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use const maps instead.
- Implement proper type safety and inference.
- Use `satisfies` operator for type validation.
