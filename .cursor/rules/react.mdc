- Use `kebab-case` for all file names
- Use idiomatic React
- Put components in `components` directory
- Reuse and compose components when possible
- Use `zod` for validation
- Structure components logically: exports, subcomponents, helpers, types.
- Use descriptive names with auxiliary verbs (isLoading, hasError).
- Prefix event handlers with 'handle' (handleClick, handleSubmit).
- Don't write a custom render function for a component.

## Component Structure
- Use functional components over class components
- Keep components small and focused
- Group tightly coupled components in the same file when they share logic
- Separate reusable components into individual files
- Create main orchestrator components that compose the feature
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Use composition over inheritance
- Implement proper prop types with TypeScript
- Split large components into smaller, focused ones.

## Hooks
- Follow the Rules of Hooks
- Use custom hooks for reusable logic
- Keep hooks focused and simple
- Use appropriate dependency arrays in useEffect
- Implement cleanup in useEffect when needed
- Avoid nested hooks

## State Management
- Use useState for local component state
- Implement useReducer for complex state logic
- Use Context API for shared state across multiple components
- Keep state as close to where it's used as possible
- Avoid prop drilling through proper state management
- Use state management libraries only when necessary
