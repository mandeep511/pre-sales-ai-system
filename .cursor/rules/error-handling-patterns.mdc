description: Error handling patterns for Next.js 15 and React 19 applications, including error boundaries, API error handling, and graceful degradation strategies.
globs: app/**/*
---
## Error Boundaries & UI
- Use Error Boundaries at appropriate component hierarchy levels (including RSC)
- Implement fallback UI for error states
- Use Next.js error pages: `error.tsx`, `not-found.tsx`, `global-error.tsx`

## API & Async Operations
- Wrap async operations in try/catch blocks
- Return proper HTTP status codes (4xx client, 5xx server)
- Centralize API error handling with interceptors/wrappers
- Implement timeouts and circuit breakers for external services
- Handle streaming responses (AI services, etc.)

## Error Recovery & Resilience
- Implement retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Validate inputs before processing
- Use error codes for debugging (not generic messages)

## Logging & Monitoring
- Log errors with Sentry/LogRocket in production
- Use environment-specific verbosity (verbose dev, minimal prod)
- Track errors with monitoring services

## Specific Contexts
- Server actions & form submissions
- Database operations & connection pooling
- File uploads & processing
- Authentication & authorization
- Third-party API integrations
- WebSocket & real-time features

## Security & Serialization
- Show informative but non-sensitive error messages to users
- Properly serialize errors when passing server → client
