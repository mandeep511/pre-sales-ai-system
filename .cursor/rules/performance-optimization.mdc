globs: app/**/*
---
- Implement proper caching strategies with `cache` function for data fetching.
- Use `loading.tsx` for skeleton screens and improved perceived performance.
- Minimize the number of re-renders by using `useMemo` and `useCallback`
- Avoid using `useEffect` when not needed
- Implement proper lazy loading for components and images.
- Use `useTransition` for non-urgent updates to maintain responsiveness.
- Use `React.memo` for components with expensive render operations.
- Implement proper pagination for large data sets.
- Use `useDeferredValue` for deferring UI updates that aren't urgent.
- Optimize API routes with proper caching headers.
- Implement proper error boundaries to prevent cascading failures.
- Use `prefetch` for links to preload pages and data.
- Use `generateStaticParams` for static generation of dynamic routes.
- Use `useOptimistic` for optimistic UI updates to improve perceived performance.
